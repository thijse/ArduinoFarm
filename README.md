# ArduinoFarm

ArduinoFarm is a project in very early stage of development. Its goal is to become a testenvironment for Arduino sketches and libraries. 
The studio will manage USB connections to multiple boards of different types. It will compile sketches for these  boards, upload the compiled code
and run this code. The output will be fetched and parsed. The farm will understand Arduino Unit output, and report on any failed tests
